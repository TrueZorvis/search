## Search Algorithms in Python

- Membership Operators
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Jump Search
- Fibonacci Search
- Exponential Search
- Interpolation Search

Choosing which algorithm to use is based on the data you have to search through.

- If you want to search through an unsorted array or to find the first occurrence of a search variable, the best option is linear search.
- If you want to search through a sorted array, there are many options of which the simplest and fastest method is binary search.
- If you have a sorted array that you want to search through without using the division operator, you can use either jump search or Fibonacci search.
- If you know that the element you're searching for is likely to be closer to the start of the array, you can use exponential search.
- If your sorted array is also uniformly distributed, the fastest and most efficient search algorithm to use would be interpolation search.

If you're not sure which algorithm to use with a sorted array, just try each of them out along with Python's time library and pick the one that performs best with your dataset.
